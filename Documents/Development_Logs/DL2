Development Log (Date: 11/05/22 -- 11/11/22)

Weekly Goals
Our goals last week were to filter the datasets and store the data into the graph data structure. We did not accomplish this since we did not properly 
assign the tasks to each member. We still needed to specify what data structures to use to store the graph with.

Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We did not complete any tasks this week. We simply assigned tasks for the following week.

Problems Encountered
We did not encounter any problems this week.

Plans for next week
We will filter out datasets and store them into a vector of linked-lists as the implementation of the graph. Concretely, we will finish writing the 
structs and start to construct the class and finish the constructor of the class.

Optional: Questions for mentor
None for now. If we need, we will email out mentor.
