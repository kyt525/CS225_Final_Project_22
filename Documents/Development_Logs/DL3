Development Log (Date: 11/11/22 -- 11/18/22)

Weekly Goals
Our goals were to finish writing the structs and start to construct the class, specifically, finish the constructor of the class.

Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Set up the data structure -made the graph class -made the structs -started writing the member functions (distance calculator)

Problems Encountered
We haven't tested the code yet because we want to create a Makefile for testing. We haven't completely cleaned the data either, 
which we had expected to do by the end of the week.

Plans for next week
We plan on finishing cleaning the data and storing it in the graph. We also will implement the BFS traversal and then finish the 
Makefile and simple test cases for testing the code we have written.

Optional: Questions for mentor
None for now. If we need, we will email our mentor.
