Minions of Neha Team Contract

Communication
-------------
Team Meetings: twice a week to as needed. We will meet on Sunday and Friday evenings so we can decide what to do over the weekend and throughout the week. At least an hour each meeting, and we will meet in person. One or more of us will take notes each meeting.

Assistance: We will text each other as needed, and we should respond to each others' texts as we see them if we are not busy. However, the maximum wait time for responses should be a day.

Respect: When we are discussing a topic, we will ask each member's opinions before we proceed to the next topic. We expect all members to be off of their phones and focused on the present topic when another member is sharing their opinions.


Collaboration
-------------
Work Distribution: We will decide on our goals and deliverables for the week, and we will split the goals and deliverables into four even parts in terms of time commitment. We will first volunteer to decide which member gets which section, if no one volunteers for any of the parts, we will choose a member randomly and assign accordingly.

Time Commitment: We will expect at least three hours of work each week for each member. If we have conflict where a member cannot follow the time commitment assigned at the start of each week, we will redistribute the work to other members and the said member would make up for the missed time commitment in the future.

Conflict Resolution: If we have a disagreement between members, we will vote on the topic and discuss about the pros and cons of the situation. If one or more members have not accomplished their tasks, the said member(s) would make up for it in future weeks. We will give a grace period of half a week to complete the tasks in addition to the next week's tasks.
